Hey chat, how can you delete a key in a map in js?


# ASSISTANT (gpt-4.1-nano 0.4)

Hello! To delete a key from a JavaScript `Map`, you can use the `delete()` method. Here's how you do it:

```javascript
const myMap = new Map();
myMap.set('key1', 'value1');
myMap.set('key2', 'value2');

// To delete a key:
myMap.delete('key1');

console.log(myMap); // Map(1) {'key2' => 'value2'}
```

The `delete()` method returns `true` if the key was present and successfully deleted, or `false` if the key was not found.

If you're working with a plain JavaScript object, you can delete a key using the `delete` operator:

```javascript
const myObject = {
  key1: 'value1',
  key2: 'value2'
};

// To delete a key:
delete myObject.key1;

console.log(myObject); // { key2: 'value2' }
```

Let me know if you need more details!

                    const g_image = imageData.data[index + 1];
                    const b_image = imageData.data[index + 2];
                    const a_image = imageData.data[index + 3] / 255;
                    const r_new = pixel.r;
                    const g_new = pixel.g;
                    const b_new = pixel.b;
                    const a_new = pixel.a / 255;

                    // Calculate the resulting alpha
                    const a_r = a_new + (a_image * (1 - a_new));

                    const r_r = (r_new * a_new + r_image * a_image * (1 - a_new)) / a_r;
                    const g_r = (g_new * a_new + g_image * a_image * (1 - a_new)) / a_r;
                    const b_r = (b_new * a_new + b_image * a_image * (1 - a_new)) / a_r;

                    // Calculate and set the resulting color
                    imageData.data[index] = r_r;     // Red
                    imageData.data[index + 1] = g_r;   // Green
                    imageData.data[index + 2] = b_r;   // Blue
                    imageData.data[index + 3] = a_r * 255; // Alpha
