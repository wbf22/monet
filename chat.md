Nice thanks chat!

I'm glad to hear that increasing the post buffer size resolved the issue with pushing to the remote repository. Adjusting the buffer size can help prevent errors related to large file sizes or network constraints during the git push operation.

If you encounter similar issues in the future, remember that adjusting the post buffer size can be a useful troubleshooting step. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Happy coding!

Huh chaning the postbuffer size did it

It's generally recommended to include the `package-lock.json` file in your version control system, especially when working with Node.js projects. The `package-lock.json` file ensures that the exact versions of dependencies are installed when your project is cloned or deployed, which helps in maintaining consistent builds across different environments.

If you are encountering issues while pushing the `package-lock.json` file to your remote repository, it's unlikely to be caused by the file itself. However, if you suspect that the file size or contents are causing the issue, you can try excluding it temporarily to see if the push is successful without it.

To exclude the `package-lock.json` file from your Git commits, you can add it to your `.gitignore` file. Simply create a `.gitignore` file in the root of your repository if you don't already have one, and add the following line to ignore the `package-lock.json` file:

```
package-lock.json
```

After adding this line to your `.gitignore` file, Git will no longer track changes to the `package-lock.json` file. You can then try pushing your changes to see if the issue is resolved. Remember to run `git add .gitignore` and commit the changes before pushing.

If excluding the `package-lock.json` file does not resolve the issue, it's likely related to a different factor, such as network connectivity or the remote repository configuration.

I wonder if it's because I'm trying to commit my package-lock.json. Do you usually ignore that one

This error typically occurs when there is an issue with the remote repository or with the network connection. Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. Check the URL of the remote repository: Make sure that the URL you are using to push to the remote repository is correct.

2. Check your network connection: Ensure that you have a stable internet connection and that there are no network issues causing the disconnect.

3. Increase the buffer size: You can try increasing the buffer size for git by running the following command:
   git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000

4. Try pushing again: Sometimes, the error can be temporary. Try pushing your changes again after a few minutes.

If none of these solutions work, you may need to contact the administrator of the remote repository for further assistance.
