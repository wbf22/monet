# Unbounded
Hello and welcome!

This repo contains the Unbounded no code website creator. The entire app is actually contained in Unbounded.html for ease of use.
You can download that html file to edit html files offline, or visit https://wbf22.github.io/unbounded/ to use the editor there.

Unbounded is free to use and the code is in the public domain. If you'd like to support me, here's my link [https://github.com/sponsors/wbf22](https://github.com/sponsors/wbf22)

## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute, feel free to make a pull request and we can determine if we want to merge that in or make a fork instead.
If you'd like to make a fork I'm totally fine with that, and if it's pretty good, we'll link to it here.

## Other
This repo also contains a paint app similar to MS paint. It's still a work in progress but can be accessed here [https://wbf22.github.io/unbounded/Monet.html](https://wbf22.github.io/unbounded/Monet.html)

## Support Me
If you'd like to support me here's my link [https://github.com/sponsors/wbf22](https://github.com/sponsors/wbf22). Unbounded is free to use though!
